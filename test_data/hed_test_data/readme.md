# Higher Ed. Canvas Test Data

<em>Important note</em>: Still under development. The activity test data may not be completely realistic and the roster test data may not be exactly formatted as nested arrays possibly seen in production data; this is expected to be updated soon.

Tables are grouped as described below:

| Tables Group | Tables |
| -------- | -------- |
| roster data | accounts, course_sections, courses, enrollment_terms, enrollments, roles, users |
| modules activity data | content_tags, context_modules |
| quizzes activity data | quizzes, quiz_submissions |
| assignment activity data | assignments, submissions |

This generated test data set is an attempt to mimic the Canvas Data v2 table data as described in the following resources:

| Resource | Notes |
| -------- | -------- |
| [CD1 to CD2 schema mapping open-sourced spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kqCXAD9K45L0QeEtbuuMAFp2fW8o0oC8EBzJf58SjrY/edit#gid=527545099) | <em>Caveat</em>: this may not be entirely accurate since documentation author is not given. Used as a base to generate the test data seen in this folder. |
| [Canvas API Calls and Descriptions](https://api-gateway.instructure.com/doc/) | Not positive about the accuracy or legitimacy of this resource. Seems more official than the one above. |
